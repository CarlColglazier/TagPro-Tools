## Building

TagPro Tools is designed to work on multiple browsers. Grunt is used in order to build everything and tie it all together.

To build TagPro Tools, run the following commands:

1. `npm install`
2. `grunt`

This will install grunt and place the `lib` folder in the correct location for each browser extension folder.
